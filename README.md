# AI-virtual-mouse

The AI Virtual Mouse project is aimed at developing a hands-free mouse control system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This project utilizes the MediaPipe library and OpenCV to detect hand gestures and control the mouse cursor accordingly. The virtual mouse system enables users to interact with computers without the need for physical input devices such as a mouse or touchpad.

Objectives:

Develop a real-time hand tracking system using MediaPipe and OpenCV.
Implement fingertip detection to track hand movements accurately.
Enable mouse cursor control based on hand gestures.
Incorporate click functionality using hand gestures.
Ensure user-friendly operation and intuitive interface.


Technologies / libraries Used:


MediaPipe: Hand tracking and gesture recognition.
OpenCV: Image processing and computer vision.
PyAutoGUI: Automation of mouse movements and clicks.

Before starting the code.
install necessary library,
1. OpenCV - !pip install opencv--python
2. mediaPipe - !pip install mediapipe
3. pyAutoGUI - !pip install pyautogui
